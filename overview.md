
MachineLearning with SciKitLearn
=============================================
Machine Learning is a discipline involving algorithms
designed to find patterns in and make predictions
about data. 
Machine Learning is nearly ubiquitous in our world
today, and used in things like web analytics, natural sciences and engineering.

This tutorial is intended as an introduction to scikit-learn, a python machine learning package, and to the central concepts of Machine Learning.
It is aimed as those with some programming experience, but no practical experiment with machine learning. 
The workshop will mix important theoretical concepts with hands-on examples.
This workshop will cover six main topics

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Regression Techniques 
3. Classification Problems
4. Cluster Analysis
5. Model Selection and Appraisal
6. Other topics such as Principal Component Analysis
